# PAYE-and-NIC-calc
Tool for calculating PAYE and NIC liabilities.
When submitting a reserach and development expenduitre credit claim, there is a cap on the amount you are able to claim
This cap is set at the amount of PAYE and NIC liabilities incurred within the year for the staff directly involved in the research and developemnt tasks that are includded in the claim.
In submitting the CT600 corporation tax return, it can be helpful to speed up the claim process and prevent HMRC opening investigations by providing as much information as possible.
As my client is a small subsidiary of a larger company, entirely focused on R&D, a fast claim process is important to day to day operations as well as ensuring the financial statements represent a true and fair view of financial health of the company.
To ensure the claim ran smoothly.
This tool enabled me to perform the necessaty calculation in a timely manner; benfitting the client as it reduced the time billed to them and benefitting my firm as I was able to spend the time saved on more complex, and profitable, tasks.

I intend to improve the functionality of this tool by allowing it to import information directly from excel, removing the need to manually enter the salaries of the employees involved.
